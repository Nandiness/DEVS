        <p class="post-text">"AI is sometimes incorrectly framed as machines replacing humans. It’s not about machines replacing humans, but machines augmenting humans. In this technological driven society, Artificial intelligence is escalating at a booming rate taking over
            the IT sector at a rapid pace. Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that involves building a model that can perform tasks that emulate human mind such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language
            translation. AI involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to analyse and learn from data, and to make predictions or decisions based on that analysis. The example of various ai tools are Microsoft azure services, Open ai, Google
            cloud AI, Amazon Sage maker and Data robot etc. AI has a mammoth impact on humans and the society which could either benefit them or raise social and ethical issues. Some of the various domains it has affected include:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    1.Employment - AI is automating many routine jobs such as customer service and manufacturing. While it has created jobs in various fields such as data science and AI development, it has also replaced jobs in many fields.

                </li>
                <li>
                    2.Healthcare- It has helped us create many advancements in medical diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.AI can help us analyse large amounts of data and help doctor’s decision making process easier.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3.Transportation-AI is used to make autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. This technology has the potential to reduce traffic accidents and fatalities, as well as make transportation more efficient and accessible.

                </li>
                <li>
                    4.Personalization – It allowed us to personalise our actions and performed action that would favour our thought process.

        <p class="post-text">
            With the launch of new AI tools at a clock ticking rate, it has created a quagmire of fear and thoughts in the society. The talk that going on about it’s potential to replace human jobs is a myth that needs to be addressed. AI is not inherently good or
            bad, it's how we choose to use it that will determine it’s impact on society. Artificial intelligence, when used ethically and responsibly, is not a threat to human society. Here are some reasons why: • AI is a tool used to augment and improvise
            on human skills , not a replacement .AI is designed to assist humans in performing tasks that are tedious, cumbersome ,repetitive, or not feasible for humans to do. It can help us criticise our decisions constructively, automate processes,
            and improve efficiency. • AI has assisted us improvise on safety measures. AI can be used to identify and mitigate risks in various industries, such as transportation, healthcare, and finance. It can analyse data in real-time and alert humans
            to potential dangers, which can prevent accidents and save lives. </p>

                <li>AI can improve accessibility . It can be used to create assistive technologies for people with disabilities, such as voice recognition software or robotic prosthetics. This can enhance their quality of life and provide them with a hope
                    of their survival in this competitive world</li>
                <li>AI can create new job opportunities. While some jobs may be automated with AI, new jobs will also be generated in fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and AI development. This will force the people to improvise their critical

                <li>AI can help us solve global challenges. AI can be used to address issues such as climate change, poverty, and healthcare. It can help us analyse large amounts of data, create predictive models, and develop solutions to complex problems.

        <p class="post-text">
            The benefits of artificial intelligence far outweigh the potential risks, and with proper regulation and ethical considerations we can say that AI is not a threat to society, but a superhero we desperately need to solve world’s some of the most pressing
            problems!
