        <h2 class="sub-heading">What it means to us ?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">'Technology'- a word that is thrown around a lot these days. But have we tried to understand in what sense? Our parent's generation think of this word with a sense of respect and gratitude for the struggles it has relieved them of in their lifetimes.
            They have seen the transition from thumping their clothes on the ground while washing them to just 'clicking a button' to select the mode on the washing machine; from dropping coins into the STD box to make a call to dropping a DM asking their
            children to call them on WhatsApp or a Google Duo. Their generation has seen one of the most radical transformations in the history of humankind-the democratisation of information and knowledge. You don't have to go to the library or borrow
            someone's notes home to understand a subject; you have the entire world's knowledge repository in your hands and all one has to do again is to merely 'click a button' !</p>
        <p class="post-text"> But the same word rings a different tone in the ears of our generation. When we hear or use this word in the context in which our elders use it, we do relate with it, no doubt! But we also feel at the same time that the word represents so much
            more in our lives. We 'live' this word. We see how every inch of the world around us is permeated with the ether of technology. When we drive on the road we can think of the machines and the application of engineering knowledge that made it
            possible. When we use a Bluetooth headphones we think of the incredible application of the knowledge of radio frequency and wave transmission. When we use this word our mind gets excited around the prospects of it in the million different
            applications in various fields- Robots, automation, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, 3D Printing and so much more! When we see that a practice as dangerous and gut wrenching as manual scavenging can be solved in our country because
            of a start-up that has created a product for the same or when a local fruit hawker can transact with you through UPI (Unified Payments Interface) technology feels incredibly empowering and liberating! Anything that reduces human effort, suffering
            and misery in the largest scope of these terms can be called machines. The usage of scientific knowledge and understanding to create such machines, products and systems is technology. It's as simple as that!

        <p class="post-text">
            Some people though cite the negative aspects of tech in our lives. They talk of the mass addiction to mobiles or gaming and social media. They talk of mental health issues and the perils of hyper optimization of every aspect of our lives and so on. No
            doubt that their concerns are genuine and worth paying attention to but merely blaming 'social media' or 'internet' or 'mobile phone' or 'gaming' is not going to help at all! The goodness that these have brought in our lives is worth cherishing
            and building on not curtail, restrict, regulate and destroy! It's worth optimising on to ensure that genuine concerns are ameliorated but to just blame the things that have given us so much of value in our lives is just throwing the baby out
            of the bathwater! We will continue this blog with a comprehensive series maybe on the history, present and future of technology if there is enough interest for the same from the audience. Till then, glory be on Hephaestus and Saraswati!
