        <h2 class="sub-heading">WEB WHAT IS THAT?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Web developer jobs are typically skill-based (as opposed to requiring credentials like a tech-specific bachelor’s degree or even an associate’s degree), which means if you have the skills, you can do the job. Step one then on the road to web development:
            identify exactly what those skills are.</p>
        <p class="post-text"> FRONTEND WEBDEVELOPMENT LANGUAGES:
            <ul>
                <li>- HTML</li>
                <li>- CSS</li>
                <li>- JAVASCRIPT</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">BACKEND WEBDEVELOPMENT LANGUAGES:
            <ul>
                <li>- JAVASCRIPT / NODEJS </li>
                <li>- PYTHON</li>
                <li>- RUBY</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            Once you're clear on what web developer skills to learn and how to become a web developer, it's time to start actually learning those skills. Does this mean going back to school for a new four-year degree in computer science? No! While you can definitely
            pick up skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a classroom setting, you can also learn them from your own home and at your own pace.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            In addition to learning skill basics through tutorials and online classes, you'll also need to participate in online coding communities like GitHub(opens in a new tab) and Stack Overflow(opens in a new tab). GitHub is a forum where web developers can
            post projects they're working on, share code with other developers, and receive peer-to-peer comments on their work. Stack Overflow is a coding-related discussion board where developers interact through a question and answer format. Both of
            these platforms are ideal spaces to try out what you've learned and gain real-world experience and feedback. Finally, take time as you're learning to familiarize yourself with the many free tools available to web developers and find the ones
            that give you the most value. Whether it's text editors(opens in a new tab), web browser extensions(opens in a new tab), or content management systems(opens in a new tab), you'll be surprised how many essential resources are available for
            no cost.
